PRODUCTS:\r\nAll products are made to order by hand, variations in the look\/texture of the each item will vary and they are not considered defects or damages, unless completely broken or melted during shipment. Pure, renewable and US grown soy wax is infused with paraben & phthalate-free fragrances. Each candle includes an American Hardwood wooden wick. Wooden wicks are a great alternative to cotton and paper wicks. A wooden wick will increase the scent throw of your candle, as well as provide a slight &quot;firewood&quot; scent. They also make a really amazing crackling sound when lit (don&#39;t be nervous if you hear it!). Always light wooden wicks close to the base of your candle and not at the top. \r\n\r\nUSING YOUR WOODEN WICK CANDLE:\r\nWhen you first light your candles, you should let it burn until it has achieved a full melt pool (liquefied wax that has reached the edges of the container). This will establish the memory burn and will help keep the scent in your candle strong and your wax from tunneling. Your initial burn is very important, but you should let your candle reach a full melt pool each time after, as well. Burn times will vary, burn time is an approximate. If you are experiencing problems with your wood wick not staying lit, the solution is simple! It just needs to be trimmed a bit. To trim it, make sure the wax is firm and cool to the touch, then use your fingers to pinch off the burnt top of the wick.\r\n\r\nOTHER INFORMATION:\r\nDuring the hotter months, shipping your items may take place during the beginning of the week (Monday-Wednesday) to help ensure that your products are delivered to you in their intended state and not in a melty mess! I will always let you know if your items will be held just a few days longer, and if you&#39;d rather I not wait to ship, that&#39;s fine, too!

If shipping occurs during a warmer time of year, or to an especially warm climate, the wax may start to melt before it&#39;s supposed to!

You can also check to see if your item has shipped in &quot;Your Etsy &gt;&gt; Purchases.&quot; I click &quot;shipped&quot; when it is packed - it normally goes out that day - but if it&#39;s a weekend it may not ship until the following Monday. \r\n\r\nIf you need to convo me please reference the date of your order & your etsy name, if you can send me a link to your etsy invoice (found in &quot;MY ETSY PURCHASES&quot;) that is very helpful. \r\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \r\nUsual terms: I ship 2-4 times each week so it&#39;s possible your order may ship the same day I receive it, if you have a situation that needs attention after you place your order & before it ships please let me know via Etsy convos. \r\nSome items take extra time to prepare. \r\n\r\nGENERAL INFO: Your order is delayed if you have paid with an echeck which sometimes takes up to 10 business days to clear. \r\n\r\nIf you get the wrong item or if it arrives damaged please let me know IMMEDIATELY via convo so I can correct the problem or file a damage claim (if insured). You must contact me within 1 WEEK of receipt of damaged or incorrect items or I cannot fix it.\r\n\r\nPlease give positive feedback for Pioneer House when your transaction is complete & you have received your goodies and I will do the same. If for any reason you didn&#39;t have a positive experience please let me know before you leave feedback. I usually give feedback 30 days after your transaction as my priorities are getting orders shipped to customers.\r\n\r\nThanks for your support of superfine artists in the south.\r\nJulie","digital_sale_message":null,"last_updated_tsz":1444244357,"listing_active_count":339,"login_name":"YeeHaw","accepts_custom_requests":false,"policy_welcome":"Hello Friends & Neighbors,\r\n\r\nThanks for looking at PIONEER HOUSE. I have a fabulous letterpress printmaking & design studio in downtown KNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE. I utilize salvaged equipment, recycled papers and re-purposed inks in an historic 19th century building. Contemporary work with traditional materials... I have over 18 years of experience with letterpress and 25+ years as a graphic designer.\r\n\r\nHope you like what you see. Julie Belcher\r\n\r\nI usually only post 1 or 2 of each item - &quot;1 in stock&quot; only means 1 in the etsy store at a time - if you have a question about getting more than the number listed please convo me - also if you are interested in an item that is listed as &quot;sold out&quot; please ask, I may have another. I also will be selling my old Yee Haw Industries inventory that many of you have been asking for since I had to close the store in May, 2012. \r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\r\nAs with all handmade work - items are different from piece to piece. My prints are hand pulled from wood blocks of image & type with hand mixed inks. Much of my typography is well over 100 years old, dinged up and scratched. The characteristics of the materials create texture, wood grain & a distressed look when printed. I subscribe to the &quot;kiss&quot; method of hand printing not the &quot;bite&quot; method. Inks kiss the paper - thus the impression is not always a super deep one - this is the correct method in order to preserve the type so it can be used for another century or 2. The process sometimes creates ghost images on the back of the paper. These are not defects, the ink has not smeared, transferred or melted in transit. I use a variety of papers - much of it is 100% post consumer recycled and I also use paper from a family run paper company that has run on green power for over a century. \r\n\r\nEveryone&#39;s computer shows digital colors differently... so if your print varies a bit from the photo there could be several reasons for that. If you have any questions please ask me & THANKS A LOT.\r\n\r\nPlease do not steal art, that ain&#39;t nice. It&#39;s hard work to come up with original ideas but you can do it.","policy_payment":"I only accept PayPal payments via PioneerHouse.Etsy.com but if you are absolutely opposed to that I&#39;ll try to work something else out - just ask. If you have any trouble ordering please convo me. ","policy_shipping":"DELIVERY\r\nPlease supply a secure location for delivery of your order, I do not ship packages that require a signature for delivery as that most often causes more problems than not - if you need a signature confirmation of delivery please request it in advance, it does cost extra. If your package was priority mail & marked as delivered by USPS & stolen off of your porch the insurance will be denied so please make sure your delivery address is secure - consider shipping to a business address. \r\n\r\nPACKAGING\r\nI make & sell many types of handmade wares - some ship in a tube, stayflat, box, cardboard flat or padded envelope, I primarily use new packaging materials to ensure safe delivery. I know shipping costs are ridonkulous but please understand for limited edition work it&#39;s worth paying a bit more to make sure it arrives safely. If you have a concern about how your order will ship please convo me before ordering. If your shipping payment is less than it actually costs me to ship it to your location it will go a more economical method that matches your payment. How it ships depends on your location & what you order. Shipping is not just the cost of a stamp - please keep that in mind. \r\n\r\nSHIPPING PROCESS\r\nI use the shipping address listed in your PP payment. If this is a gift please let me know so I can ship it to the correct location. \r\n\r\nI ship 2+ times each week so it&#39;s possible your order may ship the same day I receive it, if you have a situation that needs immediate attention after you place your order & before it ships please let me know via convo.\r\n\r\nYou can check to see if your item has shipped in &quot;Your Etsy &gt;&gt; Purchases.&quot; I click &quot;shipped&quot; when it is packed - it normally goes out that day - but if it&#39;s a weekend it may not ship until the following Monday. I do not know if you do not receive your item unless you tell me & the post office is not 100% reliable - nor is any shipping method, please let me know if you don&#39;t receive your order.\r\n\r\nIf you order a single or a few prints they ship in a tube which is the safest way to transport them without damage, simply unroll and lay flat prints upside down when they arrive, you can also gently roll the print the other way. I only ship flat for orders of 10 or more poster sized prints & there may be an additional charge. \r\n\r\nPOST OFFICE USPS and UPS\r\nIf your shipping amount was under $6 your order will most likely come via USPS FIRST CLASS - this does not get a tracking number. Normally orders over $6 will come either USPS PRIORITY MAIL or UPS & a tracking number is sent to your email, please check for it.\r\n\r\nMULTIPLE ITEM COMBINED SHIPPING\r\nIf you see several items you want in my store, you can order them & pay, then I will combine shipping & evaluate per order and sometimes refund you via paypal based on the actual cost to your location. If you want to contact me in advance for large orders I are happy to estimate it for you. As mentioned above different types of items ship in different types of packaging - multiple item purchases are not always able to ship in the same container - sometimes it will come in 2 packages. If your shipping amount paid allows I will always try to send your order via Priority or UPS so it can be tracked.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL ORDERS \r\nI have had so many requests for international orders that I have decided to try it again. If you would like something shipped to you outside of the United States please send me a convo with what you would like to order and your address so I can research your shipping cost - I will post a custom order for you with the appropriate shipping to your country. Thanks so much. I do ask that you make an order of at least $75 - The shipping method I use is USPS Priority Mail International and it can be expensive depending on the weight of your purchase and where it is going. I have had problems with items going USPS First Class getting lost in transit so I prefer a quicker method that we both can track. You will receive the tracking number when it ships. \r\n\r\nAs always if you have a question about shipping or prefer a certain shipping method just ask me, I can figure out the shipping charges before you order.","policy_refunds":"All purchases are final unless your order is damaged in transit, I do allow exchanges with prior approval. (see shipping info for protection en route to you as damages do happen). Please let me know if you are not satisfied with your purchase for any reason and I will evaluate per situation - I want you to love what you order. \r\n\r\nShipping insurance is recommended as no one is perfect & sometimes packages get run over by a truck on their way to you - no kidding, please ask me if you want your package insured.\r\n\r\nIf you get an incorrect order or if you receive a damaged package you must tell me within 1 week of receipt so I can correct the situation. After that it is considered a final sale.","policy_additional":"APPAREL SIZING\r\nI use these descriptors for tee shirt fit: \r\nADULT - These are regular cut adult shirts that are not fitted in the waist or shoulders.\r\nGIRLY - These are a more fitted shirt style with a tapered waist & narrower shoulders.\r\nKIDS - These will be better described in each item, sometimes I have infant (6, 12, 18 month) toddler (2T, 3T, 4T) youth (XS, S, M).\r\nSKIRTS - see description for actual measurements for S, M, L\r\n\r\nSorry but I am no longer able to offer products on CONSIGNMENT\r\nbut I do WHOLESALE - See Wholesale for more info. \r\n\r\nCONTACT ME\r\nPioneer House of Letterpress and Design\r\nJulie Belcher, owner & creative director\r\nPO Box 2525, Knoxville, TN 37901\r\nJuile@Pioneer-House.com\r\n","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1441889115,"vacation_autoreply":"Hi Friends of Pioneer House of Letterpress, \r\nSorry for any inconvenience but I am not able to ship anything while I am out of the studio at a show.

The USPS has increased it&#39;s rates this year, domestic parcels aren&#39;t much higher, but International rates have gone up by at least 60%. We do our best to keep our rates as low as possible, but there isn&#39;t much more we can do.\r\n\r\nOur Rates:\r\nWe ship glass, and other heavy sometimes fragile items. This means it can get quite expensive. We pack everything as best as we can but that means more weight and sometimes heavier boxes. If we find a cheaper way to ship we will lower our rates, but until they they have to stay where they are, and I promise you most times we eat 30% of the costs.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUSA\/Domestic:\r\nWe ship USPS First Class, which can be up to 5-7 business days. You have the option to upgrade to either priority (2-3 day) or Express shipping (next day). These all have an upgrade cost so please message me ahead of time so I can quote you the rates.\r\nWe also DO NOT OFFER TRACKING unless asked before the item has been marked shipped. If you need a tracking number please let us know when you make your purchase.\r\n\r\nWe can&#39;t give any &quot;guarantee delivery date&quot; because a lot of things can effect shipping times. Weather, holidays, ext. We however will do our best to get your package to you as soon as possible.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInternational Orders:\r\nWe ship USPS airmail This is USUALLY 10-14 business days with no tracking. HOWEVER depending on your countries customs regulations they can take up to 3 MONTHS. We are in no way liable for items that are held up in customs, I&#39;m sorry it is a risk we all take when we order overseas. We can upgrade your shipping to Priority (6-10day with tracking) but once again These times can&#39;t be guaranteed with orders being held up in customs.\r\nIf you would like to upgrade your parcel to Priority you must let us know before the item has been marked shipped, and the parcel won&#39;t be shipped out until the shipping upgrade has been purchased.\r\n\r\n\r\nCustoms Fee and Charges:\r\nFor international orders, the shipping charges ONLY cover the cost of postage and not any customs fees, charges, or duties that may need to be paid. Please be aware of the customs regulations for your country prior to purchase, and contact the shops prior to purchase to ensure a smooth shipping experience.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLOST\/DELAYED PACKAGES:\r\nWe are not responsible for delayed\/lost packages, purely because the cause of the delay is completely out of our control. We will work with you the best that we can to figure out a solution for the problem, but we won&#39;t refund item\/shipping for delayed packages. A way around this is tracking, it lets both of us see where the packages have been and get them to you faster if there is an issue. We don&#39;t automatically offer tracking but if it is shipped within the USA we can add it on for free, just let us know before the item is marked shipped. For tracking on International orders you must upgrade to Priority shipping.\r\n\r\nIf you think your package is lost please contact us, this is an incredibly rare occurance, but we will work with you the best way we can to figure out a solution.\r\n\r\n*********Once again International buyers please keep in mind our packages usually get to you in 14 business days but they can be delayed by as much as 3 months depending on if they are held up in customs!***********************\r\n\r\nAgain if you have any questions or concerns contact us!","policy_refunds":"Return Policies are as follows:\r\n\r\n-No returns on any stickers, Vinyl Decals, or bumper stickers\r\n-Returns are accepted on glassware (excluding custom items, limited edition sets,clearance and upcycled products) 5 business days after item was received (or 7 days after item was purchased, whichever is longer). items MUST be in original condition to receive money back.

This means if you are mailing payment, or use an e-check the payment has to not only arrive to us, but also clear before we will begin going into production on your order. We ask if you are mailing payment to let us know when you have mailed it so we can keep an eye out for it. We will let you know when it arrives, and if it needs to clear when it has cleared.\r\n\r\nWe are also not responsible for any lost payments in the mail, so send it safely!\r\n\r\nYou have 14 days to pay for an item before it will be re-listed and the transaction cancelled.

The USPS has increased it&#39;s rates this year, domestic parcels aren&#39;t much higher, but International rates have gone up by at least 60%. We do our best to keep our rates as low as possible, but there isn&#39;t much more we can do.\r\n\r\nOur Rates:\r\nWe ship glass, and other heavy sometimes fragile items. This means it can get quite expensive. We pack everything as best as we can but that means more weight and sometimes heavier boxes. If we find a cheaper way to ship we will lower our rates, but until they they have to stay where they are, and I promise you most times we eat 30% of the costs.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUSA\/Domestic:\r\nWe ship USPS First Class, which can be up to 5-7 business days. You have the option to upgrade to either priority (2-3 day) or Express shipping (next day). These all have an upgrade cost so please message me ahead of time so I can quote you the rates.\r\nWe also DO NOT OFFER TRACKING unless asked before the item has been marked shipped. If you need a tracking number please let us know when you make your purchase.\r\n\r\nWe can&#39;t give any &quot;guarantee delivery date&quot; because a lot of things can effect shipping times. Weather, holidays, ext. We however will do our best to get your package to you as soon as possible.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInternational Orders:\r\nWe ship USPS airmail This is USUALLY 10-14 business days with no tracking. HOWEVER depending on your countries customs regulations they can take up to 3 MONTHS. We are in no way liable for items that are held up in customs, I&#39;m sorry it is a risk we all take when we order overseas. We can upgrade your shipping to Priority (6-10day with tracking) but once again These times can&#39;t be guaranteed with orders being held up in customs.\r\nIf you would like to upgrade your parcel to Priority you must let us know before the item has been marked shipped, and the parcel won&#39;t be shipped out until the shipping upgrade has been purchased.\r\n\r\n\r\nCustoms Fee and Charges:\r\nFor international orders, the shipping charges ONLY cover the cost of postage and not any customs fees, charges, or duties that may need to be paid. Please be aware of the customs regulations for your country prior to purchase, and contact the shops prior to purchase to ensure a smooth shipping experience.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLOST\/DELAYED PACKAGES:\r\nWe are not responsible for delayed\/lost packages, purely because the cause of the delay is completely out of our control. We will work with you the best that we can to figure out a solution for the problem, but we won&#39;t refund item\/shipping for delayed packages. A way around this is tracking, it lets both of us see where the packages have been and get them to you faster if there is an issue. We don&#39;t automatically offer tracking but if it is shipped within the USA we can add it on for free, just let us know before the item is marked shipped. For tracking on International orders you must upgrade to Priority shipping.\r\n\r\nIf you think your package is lost please contact us, this is an incredibly rare occurance, but we will work with you the best way we can to figure out a solution.\r\n\r\n*********Once again International buyers please keep in mind our packages usually get to you in 14 business days but they can be delayed by as much as 3 months depending on if they are held up in customs!***********************\r\n\r\nAgain if you have any questions or concerns contact us!","policy_refunds":"Return Policies are as follows:\r\n\r\n-No returns on any stickers, Vinyl Decals, or bumper stickers\r\n-Returns are accepted on glassware (excluding custom items, limited edition sets,clearance and upcycled products) 5 business days after item was received (or 7 days after item was purchased, whichever is longer). items MUST be in original condition to receive money back.

CHECK YOUR SPAM FOLDER \r\n\r\nNote: 95% of the time orders placed by Thursday are delivered by that following Friday.

If this wasn&#39;t helpful, send us an email, as we are no longer doing after-sales support directly on Etsy. \r\n\r\nQUESTION: I FORGOT TO LEAVE PERSONALIZATION DETAILS \r\n\r\nreply: you see, just send those details to the email address above with order # in subject line. we do not ship blank, non-personalized items.

This piece has hand-stamped lettering which have been filled with a metal paint and then layered  and distressed to look vintage. There is a filigree flower riveted on one side. A cluster of handmade wire-wrapped rust colored glass flowers hangs over the pendant to keep the lettering subtle. Matching glass flowers have been strung on the chain up the left side, some with tiny rhinestone accents in them. The chain and all of the hardware has an aged vintage brass finish. This necklace measures 30&quot; long and has a lobster clasp with one last flower hanging on the back end of the chain. The clasp easily hooks into any link to wear this shorter if you like. The pendant measures approximately 1.5&quot; not including the ring, and each glass flower measures about 1\/2&quot; long. \n\nAll of my jewelry is one of a kind...I will repeat certain styles and colors, however I will not make exact copies of any piece. \n\nI use only quality materials, and I love getting my hands on some difficult to find beads and findings. The majority of my components are not available in local stores, so you can be assured you have a unique piece of artisan jewelry!\n\nI take great pride in all of my jewelry pieces, and should anything break or even if you accidentally damage it, please contact me to do the repairs. \n\nThis set will be packaged in a brown paper gift box tied with ribbon and shipped in a bubble mailer. \n\nNOTE: My mannequin is a mini...please check actual measurements as a necklace may appear to be longer than it actually is. I use a macro lens for the fine detail photos, this can also distort the perception of actual size. I make every attempt to get the colors to show true to life, but occasionally they can be slightly off. Please contact me before purchasing if you need more verification of exact color. \n\nThank you so much for your interest in my shop!","creation_tsz":1444242355,"ending_tsz":1454873155,"original_creation_tsz":1444242355,"last_modified_tsz":1444242838,"price":"68.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["vintage","rustic","dog tag","flowers","glass beads","boho","eclectic","country girl","gypsy","bohemian","distressed","whiskey girl"],"category_path":["Jewelry","Necklace"],"category_path_ids":[68887482,69151567],"materials":["charm","metal","rhinestone","glass"],"shop_section_id":null,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1444242355,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/251073110\/whiskey-girl-handstamped-rustic-vintage?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":1,"num_favorers":2,"shipping_template_id":10262723584,"processing_min":null,"processing_max":null,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2015","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":null,"is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":1218,"taxonomy_path":["Jewelry","Necklaces","Beaded Necklaces"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":846497282,"hex_code":"9A938C","red":154,"green":147,"blue":140,"hue":30,"saturation":9,"brightness":60,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1444242356,"listing_id":251073110,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8520648\/il_75x75.846497282_50bg.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8520648\/il_170x135.846497282_50bg.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8520648\/il_570xN.846497282_50bg.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8520648\/il_fullxfull.846497282_50bg.jpg","full_height":1148,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":846497386,"hex_code":"B4B1AF","red":180,"green":177,"blue":175,"hue":24,"saturation":2,"brightness":70,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1444242356,"listing_id":251073110,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8520648\/il_75x75.846497386_slya.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8520648\/il_170x135.846497386_slya.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8520648\/il_570xN.846497386_slya.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8520648\/il_fullxfull.846497386_slya.jpg","full_height":1068,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":846497404,"hex_code":"97908A","red":151,"green":144,"blue":138,"hue":28,"saturation":8,"brightness":59,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1444242357,"listing_id":251073110,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8520648\/il_75x75.846497404_4anz.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8520648\/il_170x135.846497404_4anz.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8520648\/il_570xN.846497404_4anz.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8520648\/il_fullxfull.846497404_4anz.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":955},{"listing_image_id":846270885,"hex_code":"B8B5B3","red":184,"green":181,"blue":179,"hue":24,"saturation":2,"brightness":72,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1444242357,"listing_id":251073110,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8520648\/il_75x75.846270885_q18x.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8520648\/il_170x135.846270885_q18x.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8520648\/il_570xN.846270885_q18x.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8520648\/il_fullxfull.846270885_q18x.jpg","full_height":1093,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":846270841,"hex_code":"8F847D","red":143,"green":132,"blue":125,"hue":23,"saturation":12,"brightness":56,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1444242357,"listing_id":251073110,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/8520648\/il_75x75.846270841_1y4f.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/8520648\/il_170x135.846270841_1y4f.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/8520648\/il_570xN.846270841_1y4f.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/8520648\/il_fullxfull.846270841_1y4f.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":8520648,"shop_name":"TurquoiseAndTrailers","user_id":7988324,"creation_tsz":1401817075,"title":"Creating a few of my favorite things...","announcement":"I am currently adding a number of my beautiful distressed picture frames!
